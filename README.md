# Genie-A-Voice-Assistant

Genie is a voice assistant that automates day-to-day tasks in our home, such as turning on lights and fans, sending emails, and performing other actions using voice commands. 

The voice assistant is built on a popular platform such as Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, or Apple Siri, and is connected to home automation devices such as smart lights and fans. 

The project aims to provide an efficient and convenient way to control home automation devices and perform other tasks, all through voice commands.

## STEPS

- [Choose a platform](): We need to choose a platform that suits your needs the best. Some popular platforms for voice assistants include `Amazon Alexa`, `Google Assistant`, and `Apple Siri`.

- [Choose a device](): We will need a device that can run the voice assistant platform we chose. Some examples of devices include `Amazon Echo`, `Google Home`, or a `smartphone`.

- [Install and set up the voice assistant](): Once we have chosen a platform and a device, follow the instructions to install and set up the voice assistant. 
   - This typically involves creating an account, `connecting the device to Wi-Fi`, and `enabling the necessary permissions`.

- [Connect to home automation devices](): To control our home automation devices, we will need to connect them to the voice assistant. This usually involves installing the device-specific app and linking it to the voice assistant platform.

- [Test and refine](): Test the voice assistant by issuing commands and making sure it performs the desired actions. Refine the setup as needed to ensure that it works correctly.

- [Add more features](): Once we have the basics set up, consider adding more features to our voice assistant, such as playing music, setting reminders, or getting weather updates.
